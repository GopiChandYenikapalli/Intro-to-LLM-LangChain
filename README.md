ChatGPT is wildly popular, with over a billion visits per month. Although this web interface is great for many non-technical use cases, for programming and automation tasks, it is better to access GPT (the AI that powers ChatGPT) via the OpenAI API.

As well as GPT, you'll also make use of LangChain, a programming framework for working with generative AI.

You'll cover:

1. Getting set up with an OpenAI developer account and integration with Workspace.
2. Calling the chat functionality in the OpenAI API, with and without langchain.
3. Simple prompt engineering.
4. Holding a conversation with GPT.
5. Ideas for incorporating GPT into a data analysis or data science workflow.
6. You'll be using GPT to explore a dataset about electric cars in Washington state, USA.
